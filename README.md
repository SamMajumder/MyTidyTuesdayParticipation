# MyTidyTuesdayParticipation


Hello there! :wave: Welcome to my Tidy Tuesday Participation Repository. This repository houses my explorations, insights, and code as I venture into the engaging and educational challenges provided by [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

Tidy Tuesday is a weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem, primarily focusing on understanding how to wrangle, analyze, and visualize data. Every week, a new dataset is shared on which participants are encouraged to apply their data science skills to create meaningful visualizations.

## Acknowledgements

- A huge shoutout to the [R4DS community](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) for organizing Tidy Tuesday and providing a platform for learning, growth, and collaboration among data enthusiasts.

- Special thanks to Jake Thompson for curating the dataset used in the [Taylor Swift's Musical Evolution](https://github.com/SamMajumder/MyTidyTuesdayParticipation/tree/main/2023/2023-10-17) project.
